### Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about 392 cars manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s.  
**The goal of the analysis is to understand what factors influence fuel efficiency (mpg).  
Can we predict the fuel consumption of a car based on the available features?**

#### Target Variable:
- **mpg** – miles per gallon; indicator of fuel efficiency / fuel consumption

#### Explanatory Variables (Features):
- **cylinders** – number of engine cylinders (from 4 to 8)  
- **displacement** – engine displacement (in cubic inches)  
- **horsepower** – engine power (in horsepower)  
- **weight** – vehicle weight (in pounds)  
- **acceleration** – time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (in seconds)  
- **year** – model year (last two digits, e.g., 70 = 1970)  
- **origin** – region of production:  
  - 1 – USA  
  - 2 – Europe  
  - 3 – Japan  
- **name** – car model name (e.g., Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu)

#### Dataset Size:
- **Number of observations:** 392  
- **Number of variables:** 9 (including one text variable: *name*)
